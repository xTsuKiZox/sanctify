# Sanctify Repository
Sanctify is a package that allows you to have a warning system for your Discord server via your Discord bot. Easy and quick to use!

<br>

# List of functions:
```
- createCommandesSanctify, 
- engineCommandeSanctify, 
- getDataDatabaseSanctify
```

<br>

# Importants:

### You will obviously need the package of discord.js, better-sqlite3 and quick.db" !

<br>  

You must therefore import the event functions that you need, for example:

![import](./github/importEventFunction.png)

<br>

To generate the whole Sanctify process, you need to get the createCommandesSanctify function and call it in your bot's ready :

![process for Sanctify](./github/processSanctify.png)

<br>

Remember to skim over the functions, because you will have the information you need :

![Hover over the functions](./github/hoverFunctions.png)


#### For engineCommandeSanctify and getDataDatabaseSanctify, you just need to call them in your file, no need in the ready
